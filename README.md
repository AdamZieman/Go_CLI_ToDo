# Go_CLI_ToDo


<!-- Program overview -->
This program allows a user to manage a todo list from the command line. Users can add a tasks, delete a task, clear all tasks, and exit the program. Tasks are stored on the system in the file "tasks.txt" and in the program as a slice. User input is read using bufio and manipulates the task list using a switch statement. The Task type is a struct with an ID and name. The program outputs the current task list and available commands to the user.
